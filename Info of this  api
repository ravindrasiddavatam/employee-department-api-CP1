You are tasked to build out a set of restful APIs to retrieve employee information of an organization using the following technologies:
              a) JPA/Hibernate
              b) Spring Boot powered application
              c) Spring MVC for rest controllers
 
1) Design/Develop the JPA entity layer to store Employee as well as Department information in a relational database. 
              The Employee entity has the following attributes:
              a) employee number (unique)
              b) employee name (full name)
 
              The Department entity has the following attribute:
              a) department name (unique)
 
              NOTE: One employee can only belong to one department.
 
2) Design/develop a business service layer (let's call it "EmployeeInfoBusinessService") to perform the following tasks:
              a) given a department name, find all the employees under that department sorted by employee number;
              b) given a department name, find all the employees whose name starts with "A" (case insensitive);
              c) find all the employees of the organization sorted by department name followed by employee number;
 
3) Design/develop a set of rest endpoints to perform the following tasks:
              a) Retrieve all the employees for a given department name and sorted by employee name
              b) Retrieve the department name for a given employee number
